I said from the grapevine what I heard your family isn't as large but you know there is nothing wrong with that
it's not in your control you are born into it which is what I was asking you that question earlier of which family would you be in
what is your scariest thing, what do you most worry about when it comes to parenthood
Since we are cousins and we are a small family I know about your cousin in Longmont now.
Are you real, are you really strict with your kids are you go back to discipline.

You know what I'm saying. My son likes to draw. he likes to draw
Yeah, it's your body, regulating what's happening, science
Yeah. How about your childhood friends from your community that you grew up with?
But it's also hard to see when your friend isn't happy
my boyfriend Sam has a message saved somewhere like the message that was going to your room.
has your boyfriend ever met any of your Emerson's friends?
I would certainly never buy it for myself. I like some of the doughnuts that we had that are like dough. What's that place that we used to go on your way to work?
I go pick up the buttered noodles and bring them over and then say here is your food that tastes like nothing so you can eat it and go to sleep and then eat it tomorrow
But why would you do that? Why would that be your order from a restaurant? And she lived in a sorority house where they make food for them
So I don't know what she's going to do next. Well, how old is your grandbaby?
Just thought he would be born with like just your family.
I'm pretty good, I had a very interesting morning. I'll tell you about it while you handle your texts and stuff.
Are you saying that I don't have your best interest at heart
Your college essays must have been incredible. It must've been absolutely impeccable.

I mean it's a little weird, you are working on the weekend, so it's like you know
what do I like about my work? what you like about your makeup and about doing makeup?
So what is your secret, your favourite secret show, like a show that you love that you wouldn't, that people wouldn't think that you like?
So, okay, lemme see, lemme test your age and see if I can guess. I think you're about my age. How was the, how do you, what's the oldest way you remember to get the prizes?
close by who is diverting your attention.
what's your favourite TV show at the moment.
do your parents use a DVD player?
I don't know. What are yours?
and also just in your life. What are your favorite movies?
Now you, where do you work currently? A pizzeria. Is this what you, this isn't your career though?
I might sound strange, but I feel like people buy less electronics these days because everything has been condensed. Like, my phone, your cellphone, is like ten things
So what's your friend, sorry for asking, what does she do?
I think it's not just for an interview. There's a lot of people that say, just do it every morning and yet it changes your day.
you know, very smart move but, it's just expensive, you know what I mean it's like you really want to buy that
Yeah, that's Walmart that's way better, you can get all of these things in Walmart
you have to order all bunch of stuff, but you know, they're not making money on that either but suck it,
you close the account and you can do that online, you can give the cause and then closing my account tomorrow and my my sister's

Yeah, like even HBO you can get through crime.
what do you mean put it in .
You don't really know exactly where it's coming from and so it's tough to put all your faith in that.
there's no magic science, I choose this store because of that, what are your needs? Okay.
What did your friend think about all this? Are you an adventurous spirit? He just goes along and seemed to enjoy it or what?
you never know what you could take from another culture and incorporate into your own and make it better.
I don't need your advice, I just need your cash.
I actually read a book or, imagine, I read a book on your love language and learning it, your attachment styles and stuff with your partner
it could be like a belt-like, you can latch it on to yourself like even. It's just the possibility like this is more functional than a pop socket
Okay. The first topic is my favorite movie. What's your favorite movie?
So, they're not all, so, what I meant by on the same level or on a different level is not necessarily how yours was done up. I know your company divides the students into levels.
Yeah. What about yourself? What do you do?
think of your iPhone, if you could just fold your iPhone in half.
Then you can put in your pocket and use when you want to flip it out, it's a full screen.
Sometimes you can work at your total hours too, which is another, kind of great thing
It's good to know your voice, 'cause you can then use that voice whether you're writing for children or adults. (It), And I don't think many people write
Because I know in California, they passed a bill saying If you wanna opt out of companies taking their tax, your tax your data, you can do that.
Yeah, it was nice to be out somewhere warm. I thought you said that you and your sister got
it up and try to refund yours, but I cannot guarantee this.
May I get your email ID, please?
Not like you're trying to make it a bigger deal. but that might be when you're trying to do things with ease, that might be how it works out.
So your values and principles can be aligned but you might think about how to get there in a different way?
you're walking through the building, you're going slowly with your big bag. It was like get the fuck out of the way. It's not a hotel
And we watch live sports. Have you something to watch with your kids?
you know what I'm saying, go to Dubai
No it's definitely like very stressful on you as a friend when your friend is dating a person who you know is not good.
Oh yeah, I do and I think and my husband does too. Have you ever seen a shrimp that's the size of your palm? There are some really big shrimp here in Florida
Got it. Any of your family members ever done something to put like you're on the famous.
Also your financial so it's everything you have to take into consideration. But I can't believe that if it costs that much to eat in the future.
that's the closest. I mean what about yourself.
Like in your house like growing up?
do your own thing, which was awesome and it was a great place to be. I don't know if you have any location that struck? You guys are international travel.
also your proximity to (LA), if you need to be there for the big reunion, shows or like whatever it is, or if you're new to a recording session in LA you can get there. feasibly, you know
If you can just get yourself incarcerated maybe everything would work out.
your car now I know it sounds callous but as I said sometimes I think that is a more favourable option anyway.
Don't put that in your mouth, put those in your mouth, don't put that in your mouth. Goodbye sorry, let's hold on.
Excuse me. Does your job require a uniform?
because we knew that they weren't gonna continue to buy if they are going to but it seems that the Amazon made it possible like they can give you just like print out the label
They are trying to refund your money back into an Amazon credit so why they don't return to your credit card.
the same as recycling styrofoam,it's like you have to put them into landfill and it stays there forever, and unwanted clothing now is like all-time high
and as long as we can just keep on buying it and profiting it, it's just gonna be there and that's you know
No, I mean, and there are definitely steps to cooking it, like what your mom did, the rice and then add the milk and all.
I can accommodate your agenda, but it's always just like a problem like for example when I first met Joseph
And in your city of kids that are looking ,
That's true. but yeah, that's another thing when friends don't budget correctly and then they're out there and your like I'm not giving you money.
How does he respond? He'll answer your question by reciting a line from his favourite book.
So what is your profession? How would you describe that?
Yes, then no, but your salary is pennies. Like living with an American, like a half American salary, or even, really half an American salary in South-East Asia you live like a king.
The phone, I think, things that are going to be able to do things. You know, like, let's use your eyes to, like, have the page go down and stuff like that.
It's good to know your voice, 'cause you can then use that voice whether you're writing for children or adults. (It), And I don't think many people write
Because I know in California, they passed a bill saying If you wanna opt out of companies taking their tax, your tax your data, you can do that.

get your degree, get your money and then you will be happy
That's nice. That's something that you can do with your students just to kill time if you have.
So, what's your legal experience, you have lots of legal experience it sounds like
everybody's favourite show is Martin. Why is your favourite show, Martin?
but I think so. I mean, they're not learning enough through the online classes. Some of them haven't even started online classes. Have yours?
your mom sends you useless gifts.
help me get some money, make some money give me money, you know what I am saying
you know this is how family be sometimes you just got to go with it, roll with the punches
you have to segregate all your things you can play with that, you can't play with that, you can do this, you can't do that
thing to try and bring the price down. Because for Airbnb I don't see too many coupons, like they don't give you your money if I go
Good. So what did your boss say when you called in today?
Growing up I had a parrot and they look cute, our house at all like no, get it out of your mind.
it's more important than work, it's more important than having a job and a career, cause your career got to end, your family don't end. Your family keep going, your bloodline will keep going
What's your second favourite then
we have my routine. What's your routine?
you learned a lot of stuff for your family I will be responsible
and how to be the best they could be you know what I am saying
How was your senior year in high school. Did you go to senior prom or anything?
Oh my God! Why do you pay so much?
Do you still wanna rely on human error, or is tech gonna be that exact, and that's just how you're gonna play your game, down to the millimetre?
what about all aunts, uncles, cousins? your parents have any siblings there. How, how big is that Thanksgiving Day
He's really affectionate he'll come up to you and be laying on you and rubbing your face and nice you know just a sweet baby.
So we are going to be talking about families and stuff like that and you know all that
And the stories are about your interactions with children?
I'll have to figure out, what he did because it was something where you could pick certain channels, he searched them to know about,
well, all should be like in your paperwork, what times that they can contact you, what to do
Yeah, you can just get rid of it, I mean cut your cost.
He never reached out and was like, you never sorry for biting your arm.
if you are gonna get diner food, like Denny's is not gonna be your best culinary option.
and I was like I am so smart as you know, really figure it out, I have to do something great
So that's your figure, that's how much money you are going to make.
after going out saying you've got to go to school,
to help save the day and bring the groceries inside the rain. So that was good. You never really have to bring you never have to really save your groceries.
so how many aunts and uncles you have got
What I can see is like when you find yourself in some shady places where the local hotel might not be the best. You can think. You can count that. If you hit a Hilton
and you are so yourself, you're like yeah let's go, let's go, hang out and that person is gonna fall in love with you for who are showing you are authentically, that's what happened with me,
Yeah so like, when you go in and buy your phone for example, that's from T-mobile or any T-mobile
No, and the other argument is that you'll feel better about yourself
You don't have to go food shopping and actually take care of yourself.
have any of your family members ever done something to put them in the news like you are on the brink of famousness
the things that you wanted to like when you were young and you didn't wanna listen to what your parents had to say, you come to realize that they were trying to help you and
confirmation will be sent on your email.
No. Men should have no say in it, sorry. It's not your body.
family helps you so much in little ways that you don't even think about. You got to free you
You know what I mean? that instant gratification that relies on you know, this is a game, it's in my control, sort of making that all work. What what are your thoughts on that?
Doing great. So, I have not caught up with you in a long time. Tell me about this trip that you took with this guy. What? How was your trip over in Asia?
I am trying to inquire about your current offers on movie tickets.
And the statistic was that they still want to, even if you are homosexual or your, and I love my niece, I know she is gay, I love her to death,
But he did and we ended up going and it was a pretty cool experience. I wouldn't say it was just as positive and enchanting as yours was because that sounds like it
how many jobs are actually like that. Like somebody who's weird and uncomfortable as your boss?
I wanted to hear what your thoughts were.
all my sisters went to college. They graduated college, older brother got his (masters). Schools a family. (Gotta) go to school.
So I'll just continue with these tourist artefacts, basically, that's what it was. So there are small booths size of your bathroom, you know single bathroom every single booth has the same thing.
What's your hope for your kids and stuff like that. If you could take the whole thing. How your parents treated you, your kids. What, how would you do that?
because those answers are always they can be corrected, but sometimes they're not correct. So that's another challenge. But also another opportunity to be more skilled in your teaching as well,
So we are going to be talking about families and stuff like that and you know all that
